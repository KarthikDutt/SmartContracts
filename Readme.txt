Intro

Repo for building Smart Contracts

To get started you'll need docker installed

The docker-compose is a work in progress...
but the DockerFile works
This project is written using pyteal, the python library used to write smart contracts for the Algorand blockchain

GIT PRACTICES

Developers for this project should follow the practice of a forking workflow, basic link below, you can easily google additional information or ask other devs on the team more info :)
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html

Some of our developers are working from free github and con only fork to a private repo...this can be troublesome if the developer wants to share progress with the team. The workaround right now is that the developer opens a pull request to the main repo and gives the pull request a "DoNotMerge" tag
